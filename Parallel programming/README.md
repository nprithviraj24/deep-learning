# Parallel Programming

### The need
The models developed in deep learning are extremely resource hungry. There is immediate need to parallelize the training/testing phase so that creating these models is as efficient as possible.


<br />
In this section we will deal with writing code to one of the specific framework: <strong>OpenCL</strong>
<br />

### Developing OpenCL applications

Now it's time to put the pedal to the metal and start developing some proper OpenCL applications. The basic steps would be the following:

- Make sure you have a machine which supports OpenCL.
- Get the OpenCL headers and libraries included in the OpenCL SDK from your favourite vendor.
- Start writing OpenCL code. That's the difficult part.
- Tell the compiler where the OpenCL headers are located.
- Tell the linker where to find the OpenCL .lib files.
- Build the fabulous application.
- Run and prepare to be awed in amazement.
