### Deep Learning Models
`` in the field of Computer Vision.``

This sub-folder constitute my work in the field of deep learning. I explore and build
 deep learning models that are generic, and also original with twisted combination of architectures 
 and loss functions.
 
 ``All the code is written in PyTorch``

### Models

##### Discriminative

1. Few-shot learning
2. DeepSORT

##### Generative
1. EDSR (Basic Deep Generative Models)
2. Face Hallucination using limited set of unaligned pairs.
