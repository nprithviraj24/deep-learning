### Deep Learning Models
`` in the field of Computer Vision.``

This sub-folder constitute my work in the field of deep learning. I explore and build
 deep learning models that are generic, and also original with twisted combination of architectures 
 and loss functions.
 
 ``All the code is written in PyTorch``

### Models

##### Discriminative

1. Few-shot learning.
2. DeepSORT

##### Generative
1. Basic Deep Generative Models
2. Face Hallucination

#### Future Work
 
1. Soon I will explore following frameworks for Reinforcement Learning.
 
 - [ ] Horizon
 - [ ] SLM-Lab
 - [ ] RLgraph

2. In the field of Natural Language Processing, I will explore some of 
the transformer-based language models.

- [ ] BERT
- [ ] DistilBERT
- [ ] Megatron
- [ ] XLNET
- [ ] RoBERTa
- [ ] CTRL
- [ ] GPT-2
