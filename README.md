### What is deep learning?



### Why do we need it?
Emphatic use of Deep learning is in computer vision and image classification problems. Before jumping onto that, let's understand image classification and object detection. 
    There is a great upsurge in computer vision field whose most typical applications are autonomous vehicles, smart video surveillance, facial detection and various people counting applications, fast and accurate object detection systems. These systems invole not only recognizing and classifying every object in an image, but localising each by drawing the appropriate bounding box and around it. This makes object detection a significantly harder task than it is trasitional computer vision predecessorr, image classification.
