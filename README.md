## Deep Learning
Montage of papers and models.

[models](./models)  folder consists of my PyTorch implementation
of different DL models.

In [papers](./papers) folder, I discuss about the literature of Deep Learning.

### Future
 
Soon I will explore following frameworks for <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>
 
 - [ ] Horizon
 - [ ] SLM-Lab
 - [ ] RLgraph

In the field of <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>, I will explore some of 
the transformer-based language models.

- [ ] BERT
- [ ] DistilBERT
- [ ] Megatron
- [ ] XLNET
- [ ] RoBERTa
- [ ] CTRL
- [ ] GPT-2
