## Loss function
It is a performance metric on how well the Neural Network manages to reach its goal of generation oupts as close as possible to desired values. 

Example:  <br />
 **loss** = Desired output - Actual output;
 But this is schoolboy stuff, we will most likely work with Sum of squars errors which is notable the most famous loss function in Neural Network.

 <br />
 **Absolute error**: It is the result to MOD function applied to an error with a sign or direction.
